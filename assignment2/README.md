## Conclusion

-> Median imputation handled missing values effectively due to robustness against outliers.
-> Label Encoding worked best for binary features, while One-Hot Encoding was suitable for nominal features.
-> Ordinal Encoding preserved meaningful order in contract types.
-> Target Encoding captured churn behavior effectively.
-> Z-score standardization provided stable scaling across numerical features.
-> Outlier capping preserved data integrity.
-> Log transformation reduced skewness in TotalCharges.
